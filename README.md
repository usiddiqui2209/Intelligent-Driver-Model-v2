# Intelligent Driver Model (v2)
### By Usman Siddiqui

## What is it?
An implementation of the Intelligent Driver Model differential equations (Runge-Kutta Order 4) for simulating traffic flow.

## Setup
First, ensure you have the latest version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and NPM installed. Then:

- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

- Once the dependencies are downloaded, run the server.js file using Node (i.e. `node src/server`)

- When the server is running, navigate to the port specified in the console (i.e. open `localhost:3000` in your browser). This will show your simulation running according to the initial conditions specified in the `trafficList.js` file - feel free to modify the initial conditions to your desired configuration.

- In its current state, the application runs in the browser only, but you are welcome to clone and modify the files to write the trafficList output to a local file for analysis.
